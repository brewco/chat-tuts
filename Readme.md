# Chat tutorial

First build the server and run in the background

```shell
yarn build:server
```

In another terminal window
```shell
node dist/server.js
```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000` 
Do not go to this url since it only is running the socket server. Not a website!

Then run the development server for the frontend code with :

```shell
yarn dev
```
